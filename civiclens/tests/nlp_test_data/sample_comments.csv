AMS-NOP-22-0063-0018,AMS-NOP-22-0063-0001,"I agree that an organic pet food standard is necessary.  However, some of the recommendations for USDA AMS pet food, like allowing organic slaughter by-products in organic pet food without a requirement that those by-products be USDA inspected and passed, is not acceptable.  This leaves open the possibility that organic pet food may contain condemned animal products.  Another concern is allowing synthetic taurine in organic pet foods.  There is no necessity to do that unless the food is ultra processed which it should not be if organic.",
AMS-NOP-22-0063-0027,AMS-NOP-22-0063-0001,I think I would support this proposed legislation. Encouraging and regulating organic food can only be a benefit for our society. I think one of the biggest ways we can make organic petfood better would be to classify it as food instead of feed. Feed is not held to the same high standard as food.,
AMS-NOP-22-0063-0026,AMS-NOP-22-0063-0001,"It&#39;s important to state that using synthetic products, and slaughtered animals that may be diseased, in organic pet food is not at all organic. We need this reformed so our animals can be healthy. ",

As a pet food consumer stakeholder organization, we provide comments with the largest stakeholder in mind &ndash; pet food consumers. No, the regulatory language is not clear enough to allow consumers to fully understand the meaning of organic or made with organic ingredients pet foods.<br/><br/>One of the very first confusion issues in the rule is the definition of &lsquo;&lsquo;pet food&rsquo;&rsquo;- defined by AMS as &lsquo;&lsquo;Any commercial feed prepared and distributed for pet consumption.&rsquo;&rsquo; This definition of pet food is contradictory, pet &lsquo;food&rsquo; is defined as a &lsquo;feed&rsquo; (&ldquo;any commercial feed&rdquo;). Feed is very different than food.

Taurine can be &lsquo;lost&rsquo; with ultra-processing used by some types of pet food, however not all styles of pet foods are ultra-processed. Taurine is not &lsquo;lost&rsquo; with minimally processed pet foods including cooked foods.

AMS does not clarify if the proposed allowance of organic slaughter by-products must be USDA inspected and passed ingredients or if condemned animal material would be allowed. Even though federal and state laws prohibit the inclusion of condemned animal material to be used in any food (human or animal food), pet food authorities practice selective enforcement with this rule in pet food. In response to Citizen Petition, Dr. Steven Solomon (former director of FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine) stated in April 2019: &ldquo;We do not believe that the use of diseased animals or animals that died otherwise than by slaughter to make animal food poses a safety concern and we intend to continue to exercise enforcement discretion.&rdquo; Organic or made with organic ingredient pet foods should not include condemned by-products.

Thank you.",
AMS-NOP-22-0063-0024,AMS-NOP-22-0063-0001,"There is mention of the term &ldquo;Wild Mushrooms&rdquo; in the text. Historically prior to the 20th century all edible mushroom varieties were either &ldquo;wild foraged&rdquo; or &ldquo;wild crafted&rdquo; on farms.<br/>Fungi grow wild quite differently than how most mushroom producers grow fungi indoors.  &ldquo;Wild &ldquo; mushrooms have a very different nutritional profile from fungus grown indoors in controlled environments using sterile substrates.<br/>We grow mushrooms indoors for three main benefits.  The first is protection from predators such as slugs, fungus gnats, squirrels, fungus beetles and deer which damage the crops outdoors. The second benefit to indoor growing is the ability to control climate conditions for year-round fruiting and harvesting.  The third benefit is to use sterile conditions and sterile substrates to prevent access of the fungi to mutualistic bacteria to create more uniform looking crops and extend shelf life.<br/>Wild grown mushrooms have a much shorter shelf life as their symbiotic bacterial partners will begin to consume the fungal tissue after the mushroom is picked similar to organic fruits and vegetables but the effect is more rapid reducing shelf life to typically 6-10 days for fresh wild mushrooms.<br/>Wild grown Fungi are susceptible to natural predators and only fruit when weather conditions are perfect, generally one or two times a year.  The key difference however is the access to symbiotic and mutualistic organisms in the rhizospheric biome and endophytic biome of vascular plants and trees.  Mushrooms produce many beneficial primary and secondary metabolite compounds that are beneficial nutrients.  Many of these nutritional compounds, particularly many secondary metabolites are only synthesized in the fungus in response to mutualistic organisms especially symbiotic bacteria species.  Various species of edible fungus produce a wide array of secondary metabolites due to gene expression when in contact with bacterial symbionts.  <br/>Indoor grown Fungi on sterile substrates do not produce the same range and concentration of nutrients that are produced by wild grown mushrooms.  Although indoor grown mushrooms are very healthy and contain many key nutrients they are not the same nutritional profile as fungi that utilize complex microbiome environments outdoors. <br/>New consumers are seeking nutritional benefits from the many secondary metabolites in mushroom products to help with cellular regulatory and immunology support functions.  Fungi grown on sterile substrate in indoor conditions may or may not produce the desired types of organic metabolites.  Wild grown mushrooms have a much more diverse and/or complete nutritional profile.  <br/>To provide consumers confidence that the mushrooms that they are consuming have a complete nutritional profile as found organically in nature, the FDA should adopt a &ldquo;Wild Grown&rdquo; designation in addition to the organic designation.  <br/>",

AMS-NOP-22-0063-0017,AMS-NOP-22-0063-0001,"Yes, there needs to be an Organic Pet Food Standard. Unfortunately the proposed standard is not clear enough and contains a few serious issues.<br/>First, before even getting to the issue of &quot;organic&quot; is the use of &quot;feed&quot; and &quot;food&quot; interchangeably. They have two very different meanings. The definition of &lsquo;&lsquo;pet food&rsquo;&rsquo;- is defined by AMS as &lsquo;&lsquo;Any commercial feed prepared and distributed for pet consumption.&rsquo;&rsquo; This definition of pet food is contradictory, pet &lsquo;food&rsquo; is defined as a &lsquo;feed&rsquo; (&ldquo;any commercial feed&rdquo;). Feed is very different than food! <br/>Feed is not held to the same standards as food. Manufacturing, quality of ingredients, transportation and warehousing of ingredients are held to different standards in food and in feed. Pet foods are &quot;feed grade&quot; or &quot;human grade&quot;.  Human grade is defined as FOOD that can be eaten by humans, while  FEED grade is allowed  to include illegal ingredients due to lack of enforcement of current regulations.<br/>AMS needs to provide clarification to consumers if the organic product and/or organic ingredients are feed grade or food grade (human grade).  That &quot;feed grade&quot; pet products are being labeled and defined as &quot;pet food&quot; is illegal and confusing to pet owners. Feed is a subclass of food and as per federal law is required to be given its own common name, such as pet feed. Please clarify this regulation so it can be enforced.<br/>Then there is the issue of synthetic ingredients which are NOT allowed in Organic products. The example used is taurine. AMS states synthetic taurine &ldquo;is a necessary ingredient in some pet food&rdquo;. This statement is incorrect. Taurine is a required nutrient in cat food, the legal requirement for taurine in cat food does NOT require it to be &lsquo;synthetic&rsquo;. Taurine supplements are only required to be used to replace taurine lost in over heated processed products. Natural taurine is available and I buy it for making my cat&#39;s food. (Not feed)<br/>The point is synthetic ingredients are NOT allowed in Organic products. Period. Is natural taurine more expensive, probably yes. Are the pet food manufacturers going to charge more for the &quot;organic label? Absolutely! Are they are going to charge more without meeting the organic standards? That depends on the AMS. <br/>As to organic slaughter by-products, AMS does not clarify if the proposed allowance of organic slaughter by-products must be USDA inspected and passed ingredients or if condemned animal material would be allowed.<br/>Organic or made with organic ingredient pet foods should not include condemned by-products! Or rendered products unless the rendering is USDA inspected. Even though federal and state laws prohibit the inclusion of condemned animal material to be used in any food (human or animal food), pet food authorities practice selective enforcement with this rule in pet food. <br/>Dr. Steven Solomon (former director of FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine) stated in April 2019: &ldquo;We do not believe that the use of diseased animals or animals that died otherwise than by slaughter to make animal food poses a safety concern and we intend to continue to exercise enforcement discretion.&rdquo; This intentional disregard for the law is part of the reason I don&#39;t feed any commercial kibble or canned pet food. <br/>The proposed regulations should include a legal definition of organic slaughter by-products. And make sure that there is a requirement that ALL slaughter by-products are USDA inspected and passed. No more dead, diseased, condemned (or the previous rendered) animals should be allowed in pet feeds. They aren&#39;t allowed in &quot;food&quot;. These products expose not only our pets but our children, elderly and immunocompromised to toxins and spores produced by microbes before they are destroyed by overheating. People trust the &quot;organic&quot; label because it has been vigorously enforced over the years. Letting pet foods declare themselves &quot;organic&quot; when they are not will hurt all organic products, human and pet food.  <br/>Please make these two changes to this proposal and any others NOP suggests as well as clarifying the difference between FOOD and FEED.

AMS-NOP-22-0063-0021,AMS-NOP-22-0063-0001,"This comment is exclusively focused on the proposed rules for organic mushroom production.  <br/><br/>Establishing a consistent standard for organic mushroom production by clarifying the eligibility rules is important in building consumer &quot;trust in the label.&rdquo; Clarifying standards supports business budgeting and operations. I appreciate the adjustments on behalf of the mushroom growers and the consideration of conditions prohibiting them from being able to confidently market as &ldquo;organic.&rdquo; I also appreciate your consideration of an appropriate timeframe for implementation. While I am not a mushroom operator (therefore I have no comment on whether a 1 year period is sufficient), I operated a specialty crop fruit and vegetable farm for years.  <br/><br/>Docket number (AMS&ndash;NOP&ndash;22&ndash;0063) <br/><br/>Regulatory Information Number (RIN 0581&ndash;AE13) ",
AMS-NOP-22-0063-0019,AMS-NOP-22-0063-0001,"RE: PR National Organic Program: Market Development for Mushrooms and Pet Food, Document ID<br/>AMS-NOP-22-0063-0001<br/><br/>Organic Pet Food<br/>The proposed rule should also include clarification and regulation for the term &ldquo;all natural&rdquo; in labeling pet food products. According to a June 2023 market study analysis conducted by Mintel and TreeTop titled &ldquo;Trends in Pet Food&rdquo;, 38% of pet owners seek all natural pet food when shopping. <br/><br/>The same study shows that only 3% of new pet food launches were labeled as organic. Addressing consistency in the organic pet food market through this proposed rule can reduce barriers of entry for new organic pet food products in the market. <br/><br/>I and many other pet owners are seeking more options for non-processed, healthy foods for our pets. <br/><br/>Organic Substrate for Growing Mushrooms <br/>The proposed rule states that &ldquo;However, non organically produced uncomposted plant materials may be used in mushroom production when an equivalent organically produced variety is not commercially available.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Allowing the use of non-organic materials to  produce mushrooms and label them organic will create distrust and confusion among consumers seeking to buy organic mushrooms.This can negatively affect new market opportunities for organic mushrooms. The proposed rule should revise this statement and only prommit organic materials to be used as growing substrates for organic mushrooms. <br/>",
AMS-NOP-22-0063-0006,AMS-NOP-22-0063-0001,"Using synthetic products, and slaughtered animals that may be diseased, in organic pet food is not at all organic. Synthetic products have many side effects, and slaughtered animals may carry diseases that will negatively affect the health of our companion animals. The term &quot;organic&quot; means purity of products raised and/or grown without the use of toxic, diseased, or synthetic agents. To change the regulations for &quot;organic&quot; to include synthetics and disease carrying organisms is a prostitution of the term &quot;organic.&quot; Organics need to be free of synthetics and free of disease carrying slaughtered animals.",
AMS-NOP-22-0063-0012,AMS-NOP-22-0063-0001,"As mushroom farmers, we support the proposed rule changes. These changes would ensure that other farms are following the same standards that we&#39;re already following. <br/><br/>We read the few comments that have been posted already, and we understand the concerns some have regarding the phrase &quot;when commercially available&quot;. We can agree that this phrase may be unnecessary for spawn. It is not difficult to find organic rye grains or another organic ingredient to use to develop organic spawn. Our original spawn provider could have certified his spawn as organic and had for a few years, but he stopped due to the exception and therefore &quot;unnecessary&quot; cost. Thankfully, he sold that part of his company and the new spawn producers we use are certified organic. <br/><br/>However, we think the phrase &quot;when commercially available&quot; may be a must for substrate. Sawdust is a required ingredient to produce wood-eating mushrooms such as shiitake and maitake. However, we have spent lots of time sourcing sawdust from multiple companies over the years, and it&#39;s never been able to be certified organic because the sawdust is a byproduct of trees that were harvested from a forest. The proposed rule that growers obtain a letter from the sawdust supplier stating that the trees were untreated seems sufficient to meet the ideals of the organic industry. <br/><br/>With that said, perhaps the exception should apply to sawdust specifically. We&#39;ve been able to source organic versions of all other ingredients for our substrate, so we believe other companies should be able to as well. <br/><br/>Still the proposed rules only strengthens organic integrity in the mushroom industry, not weakens it, as some commenters imply.",
AMS-NOP-22-0063-0013,AMS-NOP-22-0063-0001,"Unless the same organic standards that apply to human food are also applied to pet food, the &quot;organic&quot; seal/designation is suspect and the pet food could well contain ingredients incompatible with vibrant health for pets. That would be unacceptable. Please apply more stringent source, processing, and handling standards to the proposed mushrooms and all synonymous terms and organic labeling of pet food. Ensure that every single ingredient, no matter how small the amount is, gets added to the label, for the full disclosure that pets and their guardians have a right to receive, so the guardians can make truly informed choices for their animal family members. Thanks for reading. ",
AMS-NOP-22-0063-0025,AMS-NOP-22-0063-0001,"As an Organic Mushroom Grower I found each proposed change to the NOP market development for mushrooms to be appropriate.  I do however have a comment on its completeness. <br/> <br/>Indoor and outdoor &ldquo;wild&rdquo; grown mushrooms, particularly white rot saprophyte species, have the ability to absorb heavy metals from plants that have bioaccumulated these metals from pollution.  These heavy metals can be further bioaccumulated in the fungi from the substrate materials being used to grow the mycelium.  Is there any consideration for testing of plant materials for heavy metals prior to using it as a substrate growing medium given the fungal ability to further bioaccumulate these metals?  Can organic designation include verifying that substrate materials not contain unhealthy levels of heavy metals prior to being used to grow spawn or mushrooms?<br/> <br/>This may become important for consumer confidence and food safety in the event that growers were to use untested contaminated plant materials from industrial farming or trees from polluted sites.

AMS-NOP-22-0063-0030,AMS-NOP-22-0063-0001,"As a strictly organic consumer, I can say that the more rigorous the standards in organic production, the better. I am willing to pay more to ensure the products I buy for myself and my family are healthy for us and for all life on the planet, and I am writing in support of stronger, more product-specific regulations for (in this instance) mushroom cultivation and pet foods, but really for all organics.<br/><br/>It stands to reason that any organic product should be grown/produced with raw materials (i.e. soils, compost, water, containers) that are free from toxins, chemicals, and plastics, in keeping with the healthiest means of creation. Likewise, compound products like pet food should contain ingredients kept in their most natural state and free from synthetic or adulterated additives. I consider my pets to be family as well.<br/><br/>I am in favor of anything and everything you can do to strengthen organic standards across the board, as it only increases the quality of products and, therefore, the trust of consumers like me. As I&#39;ve previously said, when I buy organic, I do so not only for my health, but for the greater good and our collective health. Thank you for ensuring my investment pays off for all life on Earth.",
