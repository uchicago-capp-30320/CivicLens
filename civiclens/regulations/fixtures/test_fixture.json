      "summary": "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Minority Health (OMH) seeks input from language access stakeholders, including organizations representing and/or serving communities with Limited English Proficiency (LEP), to inform the development of a universal symbol informing people about the availability of language assistance services in health settings. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts.",
      "supplementary_information": "SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Please Note: I. Background Information The Office of Minority Health (OMH) Authorized under section 1707 of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 300u-6, as amended, the mission of OMH is to improve the health of racial and ethnic minority and American Indian and Alaska Native populations through the development of health policies and programs that help eliminate health disparities. OMH awards and other activities are intended to support the identification of effective policies, programs and practices for improving health outcomes and to promote sustainability and dissemination of these approaches. Universal Symbol for Language Assistance Services Under Fiscal Year 2023 Appropriations, Congress called upon OMH to research, develop, and test methods of informing LEP individuals about the availability of language assistance services. The Congressional report noted that the goal of this research would preferably be to develop a universal symbol informing people about the availability of language access services. II. Request for Information Through this RFI, OMH seeks to obtain information from language access stakeholders, including organizations representing and/or serving communities with LEP, to guide the development and implementation of a symbol informing people about the availability of language assistance services in health settings, including for health services, programs, and/or products. III. Questions \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 What methods do you or your organization currently use to inform individuals with LEP about the availability of services in their preferred language? \u00e2\u0097\u008b How effective are these methods? \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 What are the challenges to implementing these methods? Do you believe a new graphic symbol informing people about the availability of language assistance services would increase the rate at which people request language assistance services and thereby increase access to information about health services, programs, and/or products? \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Are you aware of any previous or existing symbols used to inform people about the availability of language assistance services ( e.g., \u00e2\u0097\u008b If yes, please share any information you have regarding the development and implementation of the symbol, including best practices, challenges, and effectiveness or impact. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 What should be considered in the development of a new graphic symbol informing people about the availability of language assistance services in health settings? Please add any specific suggestions you have for the symbol design and usability testing. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 What steps do you recommend for implementing, disseminating, and ensuring effectiveness of a new symbol for language assistance services, including utilization by LEP individuals, healthcare providers, public health departments, and other entities engaged in health care? \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Are there frameworks or standards that should be considered to support the development, testing, implementation, and dissemination of a new symbol for language assistance services? IV. Definitions For the purposes of this RFI, the following working definitions apply:  Language Assistance Services  Limited English Proficiency (LEP) e.g., e.g., e.g., e.g.,  Dated: April 10, 2024.
