      "summary": "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Minority Health (OMH) seeks input from language access stakeholders, including organizations representing and/or serving communities with Limited English Proficiency (LEP), to inform the development of a universal symbol informing people about the availability of language assistance services in health settings. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts.",
      "supplementary_information": "SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Please Note: I. Background Information The Office of Minority Health (OMH) Authorized under section 1707 of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 300u-6, as amended, the mission of OMH is to improve the health of racial and ethnic minority and American Indian and Alaska Native populations through the development of health policies and programs that help eliminate health disparities. OMH awards and other activities are intended to support the identification of effective policies, programs and practices for improving health outcomes and to promote sustainability and dissemination of these approaches. Universal Symbol for Language Assistance Services Under Fiscal Year 2023 Appropriations, Congress called upon OMH to research, develop, and test methods of informing LEP individuals about the availability of language assistance services. The Congressional report noted that the goal of this research would preferably be to develop a universal symbol informing people about the availability of language access services. II. Request for Information Through this RFI, OMH seeks to obtain information from language access stakeholders, including organizations representing and/or serving communities with LEP, to guide the development and implementation of a symbol informing people about the availability of language assistance services in health settings, including for health services, programs, and/or products. III. Questions \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 What methods do you or your organization currently use to inform individuals with LEP about the availability of services in their preferred language? \u00e2\u0097\u008b How effective are these methods? \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 What are the challenges to implementing these methods? Do you believe a new graphic symbol informing people about the availability of language assistance services would increase the rate at which people request language assistance services and thereby increase access to information about health services, programs, and/or products? \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Are you aware of any previous or existing symbols used to inform people about the availability of language assistance services ( e.g., \u00e2\u0097\u008b If yes, please share any information you have regarding the development and implementation of the symbol, including best practices, challenges, and effectiveness or impact. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 What should be considered in the development of a new graphic symbol informing people about the availability of language assistance services in health settings? Please add any specific suggestions you have for the symbol design and usability testing. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 What steps do you recommend for implementing, disseminating, and ensuring effectiveness of a new symbol for language assistance services, including utilization by LEP individuals, healthcare providers, public health departments, and other entities engaged in health care? \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Are there frameworks or standards that should be considered to support the development, testing, implementation, and dissemination of a new symbol for language assistance services? IV. Definitions For the purposes of this RFI, the following working definitions apply:  Language Assistance Services  Limited English Proficiency (LEP) e.g., e.g., e.g., e.g.,  Dated: April 10, 2024.

What methods do you or your organization currently use to inform individuals with LEP about the availability of services in their preferred language?<br/>Ans.,  traditional language identification sheet, business card with Interpreter Services&#39; contact information in LEP&#39;s target language and a short description of LEP&#39;s language preference in English so LEP persons showing up alone in clinic make themselves known to others<br/><br/>Q.2. What are the challenges to implementing these methods? Traditional language identification sheets assume the LEP is literate with written words.  It&#39;s effectiveness depends on whether the staff is aware of that sheet and use it properly.<br/><br/>Q.3 Do you believe a new graphic symbol would increase the rate at which people request language assistance services?   with mandatory measures to display the symbol in conspicuous places of healthcare facilities and proper training to workforce, it&#39;ll have positive effect.<br/><br/>Q.4 Are you aware of any previous or existing symbols used to inform people about the availability of language assistance services?   A random search on Internet shows a lot of symbols are used/designed by different organizations.  Usually, it depicts 3 persons lined up in a triangle; the bottom left &amp; right facing towards the one on the top with speech bubbles showing an image of foreign language and English.<br/><br/>Q.5 Please share any information you have regarding the development and implementation of the symbol? <br/>* the graphic symbol should be simple, highly visual (see attached link), to the point, (https://patientengagementhit.com/features/understanding-patient-rights-to-medical-interpreters-language-access)<br/>* since this symbol applies to healthcare settings, typical characteristics of healthcare provider e.g, stethoscope, vintage nursing cap, etc should be considered in the image<br/>* a cohesive image of an interpreter/translator&#39;s image should carry something like a headset, talking, hand signing, <br/>* the symbol be designed with 3 layouts, 1 without any written description, even illiterate LEP (those who don&#39;t read) can recognize; another layout with a short caption underneath; eg., civil right: language assistance for LEP person [target language].  This serves purpose of empowering LEP persons that this is their right.<br/>",

This rule identifies semi-automatic firearms under new Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs); adds additional license requirements for Crime Control and Detection (CC) items, thereby resulting in additional restrictions on the availability of license exceptions for most destinations; amends license review policies so that they are more explicit as to the nature of review that will accompany different types of transactions and license exception availability (including adding a new list of high-risk destinations); updates and expands requirements for support documentation submitted with license applications; and better accounts for the import documentation requirements of other countries (such as an import certificate or other permit prior to importation) when firearms and related items are authorized under a BIS license exception. BIS is publishing this rule as an IFR to solicit comments from the public on additional changes to export controls on firearms and related items that would better protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.",
