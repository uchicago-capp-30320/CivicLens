### Architecture Documentation

Write a summary of your application's architecture aimed at onboarding a new team member.

What key details do they need to know?

Key questions to consider, not all will apply to your project:

* Where does data come from?
* How does data flow through the system?
* What is the relationship between different modules? (I strongly suggest creating a dependency graph to show which modules depend upon which. If your graph is convoluted that is a sign that you may need to consider refactoring at some point.)
* What key concepts does the user need to understand?
